description: >-
  The module re-implements (a subset of) the models and options described and
  documented in Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process
  Analysis by Andrew Hayes (www.guilford.com/p/hayes3). The original software is
  available for SPSS and SAS (processmacro.org). The current implementation 
  creates a syntax for lavaan (lavaan.org) which then carries out the estimation
  and provides functrionality for visualizing the results as concept and
  statistical diagrams. The implementation tries to match the workflow and
  processing steps described in the appendices of the book
  (www.guilford.com/p/hayes3) with Appendix A containing the model number
  templates for the implemented models and Appendix B giving instructions for
  creating your own models or modifying numbered models (not all models and
  options are implemented yet).
